# Lexure

Lexure is an application that takes a recorded lecture in .wav format, produces:
* A searchable text file
* Topics covered
* Abstract of the lecture

For lectures, this will allow students to improve their process in the following ways:
1. Students will be able to select a topic and see all the times the topic was mentioned in a selected lecture or set of lectures.
2. At any point in the translated text-from-speech document, a student will be able to hit “play” and hear exactly what the professor said, allowing them to study more effectively.
3. All lectures will be summarized via abstract generation, which will allow the student to be better prepared for the next class by quickly reviewing the previous lecture.
4. All information will be easily shareable with other students (i.e. missed class? Here’s the entire, searchable lecture with topics and a summary).
